# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Reviews
Sentiment analysis on Reviews given by viewers on IMDB
The Dataset and The Problem to Solve
In this notebbok, weâ€™ll use an IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 2 columns (review and sentiment) that will help us identify whether a review is positive or negative. Problem formulation: Our goal is to find which machine learning model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input).
